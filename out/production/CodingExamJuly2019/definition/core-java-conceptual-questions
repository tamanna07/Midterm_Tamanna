Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.programming language is a formal language, which composites a set of instructions specifically for
a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.





What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK are a set of tools and libraries that are needed to run a java program.
Java Compiler: Reads class and interface definitions and compiles them into bytecode class files.

Explain the entire java life cycle.

- Any text editor can be used to create the high-level Java text file.
- File is saved as a .java file on the disk.
- Compile this text file using the Java compiler
- .class file being created on the disk. The .class file contains the bytecodes.
- file is loaded into memory by the class loader.
- bytecode verifier confirms bytecodes are valid and not hostile.
- JVM reads the bytecodes in memory and translates them into machine code.

what is class?
-a class is a blueprint of a object.

What is object?
-an object is an instance of a class

What is the entry point of an application?
-main function

Why main is static?
-Because main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made.
Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
-Object class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
- Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
- Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path of classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-an interface can only have abstract methods
-an abstract class can have both abstract method and regular methods

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
-no neither can't have a object, they have to be extended or implemented by a regular class.

what is Access Specifier?
-Access specifiers establish the permissions we have to access or modify members of a class within a certain scope.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
-oop stands for object oriented programming. all java applications are based on the concept of objects.
   they are:
   inheritence: this is when a child class has access to the properties of its parent class .
   polymorhism: method overloading and and method overriding
   encapsulation: data hiding or data binding
   abstraction: implentation hiding.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
-Package in Java is used to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces. It prevents naming conflicts,
makes searching and locating easier and provides controlled access.
-Three packages are imported by default for each source file. First, the package with no name.
Second, the java.lang package. And third, the current package (the package in which the current file is defined).

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
-Application Programming Interface is a set of definitions,communication protocols and tools for building software.
    -Scanner, String, Math, Random, etc.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
-No. because multiple inheritance wil causes ambiguity error.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
-Having methods with the same name. It's used when you need the same methods but with different parameters.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
-exceptions are any event that disrupt the natural flow of an application, but can be handled without the need to
terminate the application. You can handle an exception with a try catch block or throws keyword.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
-the static keyword indicates that a member belongs to a class rather than a object. static variables are shared by all objects
and static methods can be accessed without needing a object reference

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
- the final keyword indicates that a member cannot be changed once declared. a final variabe cannot be changed
 and a final method cannot be overriden

What is final, finally and finalize?
-finally is a block of code that executes after a try catch block for code cleanup,
finalize is a method called by java garbage collector that closes any open resources before destroying a object

What is a constructor ?
-Constructor is used to initialize an object. A class can have multiple constructor. constructors have the same name as their class.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
-yes

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
-default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
-this keyword refers to current object

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
- the super keyword is a reference to the parent class of an object
"Super" keyword is used to call the constructor, methods and properties of a parent class. 
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable. 
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method. 
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.  

What is JVM stand for ?
-java virtual machine

Is JVM platform independent?
-yes

What version of java are you using?
-Version 1.8

What is JAR stand for ?
-Java ARchive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
-jdk stores all the tools and files need by java to run properly, Jvm is the executioner of java bte code

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
-jvm is the virtual machine that executes bytecode it is inside JRE which contains other libraries and components needed to
run java aplications

What is compile time and run time?
-compile time is the stage when source code converted to byte code, runtime is when the byte code is being executed

What is heap?
-heap is a section of ram in which all objects are stored

How java manage it's memory?
-all references are stored in stack, all objects are stored in heap

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
-String is immutable stringBuffer and stringBuilder are not, stringBuffer is thread safe, StringBuilder is not

What is Singleton class?
-a singleton class is a class that allows only one instance object to be created

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
-serialization is the process of converting objects to bytestream, Deserialization is the opposite process

when to use transient variable in java?
-when we do not want a variable to serialized

Difference between while and do..while loop?
-do while will execute atleast once, whileloop will not execute if a condition is not met

What is Enum?
-enum is a set of constants that are user defined

What is Iterator?
-iterator is a method of the Iterable interface that is used to traverse over a collection

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
-an integer will take more memory because it is a object

Why is String Immutable in Java?
-For efficiency and security reasons.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
-Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
-Serial Garbage Collector works by holding all the application threads but Parallel Garbage Collector uses
multiple threads for garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
- Just-In-Time
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
-Heap space is the section of memory where objects are stored, Garbage collection clears the heap of any objects that are not being used

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
-in java garbage collection is automatic but it cannot be forced and it is not clear when the collection will occur

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
-stacks hold object references  and local primitive variables, heaps store the actual objects

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
-It is useful because it allows us to examine a class to see what methods, members, interfaces etc. that it
 contains or implements.

what is multithreading in java?
--Multithreading is a Java feature that allows two or more parts of a program to run at the same time  for maximum utilization of CPU.
What is the use of synchronization in Java?

-Synchronization guarantees that no two threads can execute a synchronized method which requires the same lock
simultaneously or concurrently.
-we use synchronization to allow only one thread to access a cpu resource at a time

What is Framework?
-A framework defines a set of rules or best practices which we can follow in a systematic way to achieve the desired results.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
-testng and Junit

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
-testng has all the features of junit plus added features such as dependency testing, group testing,object testing

What are the dependencies for this project?
-gson, java-json, mongo-java-driver, mysql-connector and testnghat is static binding and dynamic binding

what is dependency injection in java?
-dependency injection is when a object conatians the dependencies of another object and is passed to it so that it can use it
-static binding refers to the calls that can be resolved at compilation time while, dynamic binding are the calls that can be resolved
only at runtime
